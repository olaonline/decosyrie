# Decosyrie
The Simple E-commerce Store is a full-fledged online shopping platform that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders. Additionally, it includes an admin panel for product management and order processing. This application leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to create a seamless and efficient user experience.

# Naming
Decosyrie is a name that perfectly captures the spirit of the platform. It combines Decopage, the art of decorating with intricate designs, often linked to crafting and woodworking, with Syrie, the French word for Syria.

- Decopage highlights the artistic and handcrafted quality of the products.

- Syrie connects to Syriaâ€™s rich cultural heritage, adding authenticity and cultural depth.

Together, Decosyrie reflects the blend of artistic craftsmanship and Syrian heritage in the handmade products.
